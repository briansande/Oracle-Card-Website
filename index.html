            title: "The Inflexible One - Acherontia Atropos",
            text: `<p>
            Acherontia Atropos, the ‘Death's Head Hawkmoth’, is widely known for the skull-like markings on its thorax. This striking similarity between some hairs on a moths’ back and the bones of our own species has led to A.Atropos becoming one of the insect worlds’ most famous bad omens.   

 </p><p>

‘Atropos’ is the final of the three Moirai. She cuts the thread of life while her sisters Clotho and Lachesis weave and measure it. The genus name, Acherontia, is named for the river Acheron, which is said to flow directly into the underworld and continue there beside the Styx. 

</p><p>

But Acherontia is, like most of their creepy-crawly kin, more complicated than that. A.Atropos, along with their duly named siblings A.Styx and A.Lachesis, subsist entirely on nectar, fruit and honey, with such a preference for the latter they are a minor pest to beehives.  

</p><p>

Here we see how A.Atropos embodies a duality - Death isn’t the opposite of life, just another part of its complicated trail. Mixing both death and the sweetest nectar of life, A.Atropos walks the razors’ edge, and shows us that we can walk the same way; 

</p><p>

  ‘...there is tremendous delight in exploring the razor's edge, like a child who happens to pick up a razor blade with honey on it. It starts to lick it; it encounters the sweet taste and the blood dripping off its tongue at the same time. Simultaneous pain and pleasure are worth exploring, from the point of view of the sanity of crazy wisdom…It is the epitome of noncaring but at the same time caring so very much -- being eager to learn and eager to explore. (Chogyam Trungpa, ‘Crazy Wisdom’.) ‘

</p><p>

A.Atropos reminds us that our lives flow inexorably towards death, but that journey can glisten with joie de vivre if we allow it. Where are you denying yourself joy, pleasure, companionship, laughter, ease? 

</p><p>

A.Atropos speaks to you of using knowledge of your death to inform and enlarge your life. Thinking obsessively of our deaths can make us anxious or avoidant, but considered gently it can empower us to live on our own terms. A.Atropos reminds us that we would want to make it to Her scissors having lived our own life, so what kind of life do you want to live?  

</p><p>

The skull on their back is a forceful memento mori, the honey in their proboscis a forceful antidote to puritanism. A.Atropos calls you to fill your cup with the sweetness of life, before your thread is cut.

            title: "The Bearer of Beauty - Calliphora Vomitoria",
            text: `Calliphora’s appearance in your life suggests you have very specific work to do right now - the work of turning your grief into beauty.  

             </p><p>

Calliphora is the first creature to arrive after death, so your loss is current or recent. The adult blue-bottle lays her eggs immediately and these hatch into maggots soon afterwards. The maggots work tirelessly, cleaning flesh from bone before dropping to the ground and beginning their next stage of life.  

 </p><p>

‘Death’ doesn’t have to be only physical but can be metaphysical, mental, or the ‘death’ of a lifestyle, relationship, or job. Change is the only constant, but change comes with grief, whether we allow that grief to be felt or not. Have you given this grief the space it needs?  

 </p><p>

Heartfelt expression of grief becomes praise of what you have lost, and through this we create ‘beauty’. Calliphora guides you in this work.  

 </p><p>

‘Beauty is anything seen, felt, or realised that charms or delights the better part of us into wanting to live on, in order to see, feel, and understand more without the scared part of us being in charge of what it wants the world to be. (Martín Prechtel, ‘The Smell of Rain on Dust.’)’

 </p><p>

Calliphora is a midwife of death, carrying the deep energy of the Crone, the Witch, the Baba Yaga. They deeply understand the ugliness of loss, but trusts this can be transmuted into new life, if you allow your grief to change you. Calliphora knows that we don’t need to move forward gracefully, and that death, like life, is messy, complicated, and individual. Calliphora reassures that however you journey is just as it should be. 
 </p><p>
 

Calliphora is a teacher of change - life-piercing change, change that renders our comfortable world unrecognisable. When Calliphora undergoes metamorphosis they experience cell death, with some of their cells programmed to self-destroy at an exact moment of development. This is the correct moment, and Calliphora is ready to guide you into deeper changes than you ever imagined. 

 </p><p>

Grieving is a way of praising the lost beloved. Praise of the lost beloved is praise of life, and praise of life creates beauty. Trust that your grief is a way forward.

            title: "The Good Ancestor - Oniscidea",
            text: `Oniscidea speaks to the past, both childhood and far-reaching history. As a terrestrial isopod that colonised the land 300 million years ago, their appearance is a sign that the ancestors are protecting you.  

             </p><p>

Of course, ‘ancestors’ don’t have to be just our blood relatives. Especially for LGBT+ people and other outsiders, many of our ‘ancestors’ are community founders, intellectual or spiritual elders, and those who have inspired or helped us, even after passing on. Where colonialist ideals of the nuclear family have been used to de-legitimise our relationships, we foster a wider sense of ‘family’. You can engage with these ‘good ancestors’ as easily as your biological ones - perhaps they have a message for you. Take the time to tune into them in meditation, or update your ancestor altar. 

 </p><p>

Oniscidea are edge-walkers, world-traversers and migrants, born from the sea but living on land. In this sense Oniscidea speaks to your need for flexibility and to move between spaces. Change is the only constant; are you resisting something?  

 </p><p>

Water evaporates through Oniscidea’s cuticle constantly, so they must work hard to avoid drying out. Consider areas of your life where you’re too brittle, and what you could do to make life more juicy. Difficult situations often benefit from an injection of play or rest, like rain on dry earth. 

 </p><p>

Oniscidea curls into themselves, and are largely nocturnal. Here we find a suggestion of  where you could find your much-needed spring - in dark, fertile inner spaces. Where could you bend inwards a little more, without compromising your protection?  

 </p><p>

Gods of small joys, they relish invisible gifts, time with close friends, the cosy indoors, blanket-forts. Oniscidea’s appearance is a sign for the go-getters to slow down and look a little closer to home. 

 </p><p>

Despite all these lofty themes, Oniscidea are sweet and joyful spirits. They have cute regional nicknames across the world (cheeselogs, roly-polys), and make good, albeit peculiar, pets. They’re charming, helpful allies, long loved by gardeners for recycling dead plant and animal matter. 

 </p><p>

If Oniscidea is speaking to you, pay attention to the invisible gifts and support you have. Ask your ancestors for their blessing. Consider where turning inwards or to the dark may help nourish you, and take stock of where leaf-litter and cosy corners could be upcycled into sweetness and joy.

            title: "The Recluse - Loxosceles Reclusa",
            text: `The venom of Loxosceles is considered ‘medically significant’, that is, dangerous to human bodies, but not as dangerous as their fearsome reputation would warrant. Most L.Reclusa bites do nothing, with 37% causing necrotic skin damage, and 14% causing systemic illness. Of course these are a worry, but the species is not aggressive; L.Reclusa is named as such for a reason! They live their lives in dark, secret places, away from company. These sanctuaries, unfortunately, are very often in human homes.  

             </p><p>

Bites occur most often when the spider is pressed against the skin, often due to it hiding in clothes or shoes.  

 </p><p>

What is being held too close? What are you barely aware of that is right up against your skin? You’re taking a huge gamble behaving so carelessly - the bites aren’t often damaging, but are you happy to take that risk? Loxosceles is warning that it would serve you to tread more carefully, or step back entirely.
 </p><p>

The Recluse is concomitant to ‘The Hermit’ in Tarot. A.E.Waite writes that the Hermit’s lesson is that ‘...the Divine Mysteries secure their own protection from those who are unprepared.’ Loxosceles is not deliberately harmful, simply defending itself from insensitive approaches. 

 </p><p>

Are you exploring forgotten realms and dark spaces? This is a good and necessary thing, but Loxosceles warns you to step carefully, and look for dangers hidden behind a veil. 

 </p><p>

Of course, forcing things to be how you want them to be can be seductive. Loxosceles is warning that strong-arming things to please yourself will come back to bite you. Where are you fighting the flow of divine timing? What are you pushing out of the dark which is better left alone? Loxosceles councils us to wait. Perhaps now is not the time, perhaps we need to come back with a brighter light, or more comrades. 

 </p><p>

At the same time, The Recluse also teaches us the merits of solitude, silence and sanctuary. They want to withdraw, to be left alone, to watch from the shadows. Quiet and seclusion could serve you now. Build a sanctuary, interior or exterior, and wait and see.  

 </p><p>

The fiddle on Loxosceles’ back calls you forward into the darkness whilst counselling caution. It promises the discovery of new light through careful explorations in secret places. In its peaceful sanctuary, the violin sings to you: ‘Where I am, you also may be.’

            title: "The Climax - Brachinus Crepitans",
            text: `In the most singular defence mechanism of the bug world, Brachinus expels powerful explosions of boiling, corrosive chemicals onto their would-be predators. This incredible and unique process is the result of mixing two chemicals in the beetles’ abdomen. When a threat is sensed, a valve opens in the abdomen, allowing the chemicals to combine in a vestibule that is lined with a reactionary enzyme. The resulting exothermic reaction creates pressure that pushes the valve shut to protect the beetles’ organs and forces the chemicals out of the abdomen onto the attacker. 

 
             </p><p>
Separate, with only one or even two ingredients, Brachinus’ explosive chain reaction could never take place. Consider what disparate things you have collected around and within you. Your skills, experiences, environment, support structures, character. If Brachinus is speaking to you your alchemists’ work of gathering and uniting is done. Now you’re at critical mass, the climax, where all that is left to do is allow release.  

 </p><p>

Brachinus’ outburst is a weapon to defend itself from certain death, and perhaps yours is too, or perhaps it is not. This could be a final stand to push away what you don’t want, that which is draining or harming you, a literal predator. Or this could be the moment you release a project, life stage, or allow a new part of yourself out into the world. 

 </p><p>

Perhaps you don’t feel safe to proclaim yourself to the world so boldly, to take up space; remember Brachinus’ weapon is your weapon, and Brachinus’ weapon is 100° C of caustic fluid, able to burn through predators, fears, and the defences of hard hearts and closed minds.  Brachinus’ appearance is the sign that this is the time. Whether you are conscious of it or not, your hard work has led you here. This challenge is not beyond you - far from it. Brachinus is here to show you that even small spirits are powerful.  
 </p><p>
 

Take note of any internal tension- Brachinus doesn’t use muscle power to force out its acerbic cocktail, but uses naturally built up pressure to push open doors to the world. Consider the Chinese concept of wu wei - ‘effortless action’. This isn’t passivity, this isn’t ‘do nothing.’ Rather, it is following correct timing, flowing with the tide, and ‘sailing rather than rowing’ (Alan Watts).  

 </p><p>

You will know which part of your life this ‘climax’ sits in. Perhaps your current work of allowing, of following effortlessly, is frightening, and it certainly may not feel ‘effortless’! You may have come to the end of a period of non-action and hiding and now you can feel that you have to stand out, step up, although perhaps you are also resisting and avoiding it, and perhaps this work is very hard. But this movement is natural. You are on the path. Brachinus compels you to trust that you are ready for the grand finale, and ready for the next stage that follows. Effortless action.
